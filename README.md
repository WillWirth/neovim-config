# My Current Neovim Config
This Neovim config is by no means complete and will continue to change as time goes on.


## ToDo's

1. Add keymaps for autocomplete/luasnip.

2. Reorganization of keymaps (there are still some maps left in config files rather than main remap.lua).

3. Lots more as time goes on.
